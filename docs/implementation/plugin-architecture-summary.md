# Plugin Architecture - Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. PRD Updates ✅
- Added comprehensive plugin architecture section
- Defined plugin interfaces for temporal markers and transcription
- Added S3 multi-tenant structure with environment variables
- Added Celery orchestration status reporting architecture
- Updated implementation phases to include plugin development

### 2. Architecture Design ✅
- **Temporal Marker Plugins**: For detecting interesting timestamps (shots, objects, scenes, custom events)
- **Transcription Plugins**: For audio-to-text conversion with metadata
- **Plugin Registry**: Dynamic discovery and capability-based selection
- **Multi-Provider Support**: AWS, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and custom providers

### 3. Multi-Tenancy Design ✅
- S3 bucket structure supporting project isolation
- Environment variables: `S3_BUCKET` (ingestion) and `S3_OUTPUT_BUCKET` (retrieval)
- MongoDB schema updates with project_id tracking
- Path structure: `/projects/{project_id}/videos/{video_id}/...`

### 4. Progress Reporting Design ✅
- Defined ingestion phases for granular tracking
- Real-time updates via Celery task state
- WebSocket support for live progress streaming
- Comprehensive metadata at each phase

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Base Infrastructure (8 hours)
1. **Create Base Classes** (2 hours)
   - `BaseTemporalPlugin` with standard interface
   - `BaseTranscriptionPlugin` with standard interface
   - Common utilities and error handling

2. **Implement Registries** (2 hours)
   - Dynamic plugin discovery
   - Capability-based selection
   - Cost optimization logic

3. **Update Orchestration** (4 hours)
   - Integrate plugin system
   - Remove hardcoded providers
   - Add parallel execution

### Phase 2: AWS Plugins (8 hours)
1. **AWS Rekognition Plugin** (4 hours)
   - Refactor existing code into plugin
   - Shot detection, object tracking, scene changes
   - Proper S3 handling and cost tracking

2. **AWS Transcribe Plugin** (4 hours)
   - Full transcription with timestamps
   - Speaker diarization support
   - Language detection

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Updates (8 hours)
1. **S3 Multi-Tenancy** (2 hours)
   - Update S3 utils with project paths
   - Environment variable configuration
   - MongoDB schema updates

2. **Celery Progress Reporting** (3 hours)
   - Implement phase tracking
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Error and warning collection

3. **Testing** (3 hours)
   - Unit tests for plugins
   - Integration tests
   - Multi-tenant isolation tests

## Key Benefits

### 1. Flexibility
- Easy to add new providers without core changes
- Support for multiple providers per task
- Graceful fallbacks on failure

### 2. Cost Optimization
- Track costs per provider
- Choose optimal provider based on requirements
- Batch processing for efficiency

### 3. Scalability
- Multi-tenant ready from the start
- Parallel processing capability
- Cloud-native architecture

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent interfaces
- Comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Start with base class implementation
2. Create AWS Rekognition plugin
3. Test with existing video pipeline

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Add AWS Transcribe plugin
2. Implement NVIDIA plugins
3. Create integration test suite

### Medium Term (Month 2)
1. Add more providers (OpenAI, Google)
2. Build plugin marketplace
3. Implement advanced features

## Technical Debt Addressed
- **ORCH-003**: Removes hardcoded provider in temporal markers
- **ORCH-001**: Improves error handling with plugin fallbacks
- **ORCH-002**: Enables retry logic at plugin level

## Success Metrics
- All AWS features working through plugins
- No hardcoded provider references
- Cost tracking accurate to ±5%
- Plugin switching without code changes
- Multi-tenant isolation verified

This architecture positions the platform for easy expansion while maintaining clean, testable code.
