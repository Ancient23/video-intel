# Video Intelligence Platform

A scalable video analysis platform that transforms videos into searchable, conversational knowledge bases.

## Architecture

- **Pre-processing Phase**: Extract comprehensive knowledge from videos
- **Runtime Phase**: Enable real-time conversational AI during video playback

## Development Knowledge Base

This project includes a development knowledge base powered by the same RAG technology we're building.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Query development patterns
./dev-cli ask "How should I implement video chunking?"

# Get implementation suggestions
./dev-cli suggest "mongodb_models"

# Check project status
./dev-cli status
```

## Setup

See `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.
