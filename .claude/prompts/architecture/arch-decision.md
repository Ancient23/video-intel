# Architecture Decision Template

## Description
Analyze and document significant architecture changes or decisions for the Video Intelligence Platform.

## When to Use
- Considering major architectural changes
- Choosing between different technical approaches
- Addressing scalability concerns
- Resolving performance bottlenecks
- Making technology stack decisions

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of current architecture
- Identified limitation or problem
- Research on potential solutions
- Understanding of impacts

## Input Required
- **Current Issue**: What limitation/problem exists
- **Proposed Solution**: What change to make
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered
- **Impact Scope**: What will be affected

## Analysis Process

### 1. Current State Analysis

```bash
# Query knowledge base for current patterns
./dev-cli ask "Architecture patterns for [area]"
./dev-cli ask "Current [component] implementation"

# Review existing architecture
# Check: /docs/new/video-intelligence-prd.md (Architecture section)
```

Document:
- Current architecture design
- Identified limitations
- Performance metrics
- Cost implications

### 2. Problem Definition

Clearly articulate:
- What is failing or limiting us?
- Why is current approach insufficient?
- What are the consequences of not changing?
- What triggered this consideration?

### 3. Solution Research

```bash
# Research solutions
./dev-cli ask "Scaling [component] patterns"
./dev-cli ask "VideoCommentator [similar problem] solution"

# Industry best practices
./dev-cli ask "Best practices for [technology area]"
```

### 4. Review VideoCommentator Lessons

Check what worked/didn't work:
- Similar architectural decisions
- Scaling issues encountered
- Cost implications discovered
- Maintenance challenges

### 5. Proposed Architecture

#### Design Principles

- Minimize service disruption
- Optimize for cost efficiency

#### Technical Specification
```yaml
Component: [Name]
Current: [Current implementation]

Technologies: [List of technologies]
Dependencies: [Service dependencies]
```

### 6. Impact Analysis

#### Components Affected
- List all services impacted
- Database schema changes
- API contract changes
- Client-side impacts

#### Performance Implications
- Expected improvements
- Potential degradations
- Scaling characteristics
- Resource requirements

#### Cost Analysis
```
Current Monthly Cost: $X
Projected Monthly Cost: $Y
Migration Cost: $Z
ROI Timeline: N months
```

#### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Strategy |
| Risk 2 | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Strategy |

## Common Architecture Decisions

### 1. Database Technology
```yaml
Current: MongoDB only
Proposed: MongoDB + PostgreSQL for relational data
Reason: Complex relationships need ACID transactions
Impact: New service layer, data sync required
```

### 2. Caching Strategy
```yaml
Current: Redis for API responses
Proposed: Multi-tier (Redis + CDN + Application cache)
Reason: Reduce latency and costs
Impact: Cache invalidation complexity
```

### 3. Service Communication
```yaml
Current: Direct HTTP calls
Proposed: Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
Reason: Decoupling and reliability
Impact: New infrastructure, async patterns
```

### 4. Deployment Architecture
```yaml
Current: Monolithic deployment
Proposed: Microservices on Kubernetes
Reason: Independent scaling and deployment
Impact: Operational complexity increase
```

## Validation Approach

### 1. Proof of Concept
- Build minimal implementation
- Test critical paths
- Measure performance
- Estimate costs

### 2. Load Testing
```python
# Example load test
async def load_test_new_architecture():
    # Simulate production load
    # Measure response times
    # Check resource usage
    # Verify scaling behavior
```

### 3. Cost Projection
```python
def calculate_architecture_cost(traffic_volume):
    # Current architecture cost
    current = calculate_current_cost(traffic_volume)
    
    # New architecture cost
    new = calculate_new_cost(traffic_volume)
    
    # ROI calculation
    monthly_savings = current - new
    migration_cost = estimate_migration_cost()
    roi_months = migration_cost / monthly_savings
    
    return {
        "current_monthly": current,
        "new_monthly": new,
        "savings": monthly_savings,
        "roi_timeline": roi_months
    }
```

## Example: Adding Vector Database

```markdown
## Current Issue
MongoDB text search insufficient for semantic search needs

## Proposed Solution
Add Pinecone/Milvus for vector storage alongside MongoDB

## Analysis
- 100ms query time â†’ 10ms with vector DB
- Enables semantic search
- Supports multimodal embeddings
- $500/month additional cost

## Implementation
Phase 1: Add vector DB service
Phase 2: Dual-write embeddings
Phase 3: Migrate queries
Phase 4: Optimize and tune
```
