# Context for: mongodb integration
Generated: 2025-07-15 01:30:32

## Overview
This context provides guidance for implementing mongodb integration based on patterns from the VideoCommentator project and best practices from NVIDIA blueprints.

## Relevant Patterns from VideoCommentator
1. Lessons learned from the old implementation: In the previous implementation, if MongoDB was not properly integrated, it could have led to data inconsistency and performance issues. It's crucial to ensure that the database is correctly set up and optimized for the specific needs of the VideoCommentator project.

2. New architectural requirements: The new Video Intelligence architecture may require more advanced features from MongoDB, such as support for complex queries, real-time analytics, and large-scale data processing. MongoDB's flexible schema, horizontal scaling, and rich query language can meet these requirements.

3. Best practices identified: 
   - Use MongoDB's built-in sharding feature to distribute data across multiple servers for horizontal scaling.
   - Implement indexing to improve query performance.
   - Use MongoDB's replication feature to ensure high availability and data consistency.
   - Regularly monitor and optimize your MongoDB database to maintain high performance.
   - Use MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed cloud database service, for easier management and scalability.

4. Known issues and their solutions: 
   - Data Consistency: MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it doesn't support transactions like SQL databases. However, MongoDB introduced multi-document transactions in version 4.0 to ensure data consistency.
   - Security: MongoDB has been criticized for its lack of security features. To mitigate this, enable authentication, use role-based access control, encrypt sensitive data, and regularly update your MongoDB to the latest version.
   - Memory Usage: MongoDB can use a lot of memory. To solve this, you can limit the size of your working set to fit into RAM, use compression to reduce the size of your data, and use MongoDB's WiredTiger storage engine, which is more memory-efficient.

## Architectural Decisions
1. Lessons learned from the old implementation: The old implementation might have faced issues with data consistency, scalability, and performance. It's important to ensure that MongoDB is properly indexed to improve query performance. Also, consider using MongoDB's built-in sharding feature to distribute data across multiple servers for horizontal scalability.

2. New architectural requirements: The new Video Intelligence architecture might require real-time data processing and analytics. MongoDB's change streams feature can be used to listen for changes in the database and trigger real-time updates. Also, consider using MongoDB's aggregation framework for complex data processing and analytics.

3. Best practices identified: Use MongoDB's schema validation feature to enforce data integrity. Also, consider using MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed cloud database service, for ease of management and scalability. Use MongoDB's built-in security features like authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect sensitive data.

4. Known issues and their solutions: MongoDB might face issues with data consistency in a distributed environment. To mitigate this, consider using MongoDB's write concern feature to control the number of servers that need to confirm a write operation before it's considered successful. Also, MongoDB might face performance issues with large datasets. To mitigate this, consider using MongoDB's indexing feature to improve query performance. 

In conclusion, when integrating MongoDB with the new Video Intelligence architecture, consider the lessons learned from the old implementation, the new architectural requirements, the best practices identified, and the known issues and their solutions.

## Known Issues to Avoid
1. Lessons learned from the old implementation: In the previous implementation, there might have been issues with data consistency, scalability, and performance. MongoDB, being a NoSQL database, provides flexibility in storing unstructured data, which can be beneficial for storing video metadata and user comments. However, it's crucial to design the database schema carefully to avoid data redundancy and inconsistency.

2. New architectural requirements: The new Video Intelligence architecture might require real-time data processing, high availability, and scalability. MongoDB provides features like sharding and replication that can help meet these requirements. However, integrating MongoDB with other components of the architecture should be done carefully to avoid any data loss or inconsistency.

3. Best practices identified: Use MongoDB's built-in features like indexing to improve query performance. Regularly monitor and optimize the database performance. Use MongoDB Atlas, the fully managed MongoDB service, to offload the operational burden. Implement proper error handling and retry logic in the application code to handle any database operation failures.

4. Known issues and their solutions: 
   - MongoDB's default write concern "acknowledged" only ensures that the write operation has been received by the server, not that it has been written to the disk. To ensure data durability, you can use a stronger write concern like "journaled".
   - MongoDB does not support multi-document transactions until version 4.0. If your application requires transactions, ensure you're using a suitable version.
   - MongoDB can consume a lot of system memory. Configure the WiredTiger storage engine's cache size limit according to your system's capacity.
   - If you're using MongoDB Atlas, network latency can be an issue. Choose the region of your MongoDB Atlas cluster close to your application servers to minimize latency.

## Code Examples from Knowledge Base


## Implementation Guidelines
- Always use Pydantic V2 patterns with proper field validators
- Follow the provider abstraction pattern from VideoCommentator
- Include proper error handling and retries
- Use structured logging with contextual information
- Cache expensive operations with proper TTLs
- Set worker memory limits to avoid OOM issues
- Validate S3 paths before using cached data

## Testing Considerations
- Mock external services (AWS, OpenAI, NVIDIA)
- Use pytest fixtures for common setups
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Verify memory usage under load
